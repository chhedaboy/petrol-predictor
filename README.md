Hi there!  
This is one of my first projects as a first-year student learning Python and machine learning. I wanted to try something that connects to the real world — so I decided to build a small petrol price predictor.

It uses a simple machine learning model to guess the next day's petrol price (focused on Mumbai), based on past data.

This project is more about learning than being perfect — but I'm proud of it!

pls give me your suggestion !!
